Welcome to the SF-RP repository:

This repository contains the code for a roleplay gamemode (see common definition) for the multiplayer modification of San Andreas Multiplayer I was working on during 2014-2016 on and off.
Many of the features are incomplete, broken or missing.

If you do patch it up and use it on a server, I'd love some credit.
